## 📋 Overview
Campus Navigation System is a smart, interactive web application designed to help students, staff, and visitors navigate complex college campuses efficiently. Built for **TechSprint AI Hack '25**, this project integrates **Google Firebase** cloud services to provide a seamless, personalized navigation experience with user authentication and path history tracking.

## ✨ Features
- 🗺️ **Interactive SVG Campus Map** - Complete vector-based campus layout
- 🧭 **Intelligent Pathfinding** - Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest routes
- 🔐 **Firebase Authentication** - Secure user registration/login system
- ☁️ **Cloud Path History** - Save and retrieve navigation history
- 🔍 **Smart Room Search** - Real-time search with autocomplete
- 🎨 **Visual Path Display** - Animated path visualization
- 📱 **Responsive Design** - Works on desktop and mobile

## 🚀 Tech Stack
| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **HTML5/CSS3** | Frontend structure and styling |
| **JavaScript (ES6+)** | Application logic and interactions |
| **SVG** | Vector campus mapping |
| **Dijkstra's Algorithm** | Pathfinding and route optimization |
| **Firebase Authentication** | User management and security |
| **Cloud Firestore** | Data storage and persistence |

## 🎯 Hackathon Requirements Met
✅ **Mandatory Google Technology Integration** - Firebase Authentication & Firestore  
✅ **Real-world Problem Solving** - Campus navigation challenges  
✅ **Scalable Solution** - Cloud-based architecture  
✅ **User-Centric Design** - Intuitive interface for all users

| **Cloud Firestore** | Store user path history and preferences |
| **Security Rules** | User-specific data access controls |
| **Real-time Updates** | Instant sync across devices |

## 🎮 How to Use
1. **Browse Map**: Click on rooms to select start/end points
2. **Search**: Type room names (T-001, Library, Canteen) to find locations
3. **Calculate Path**: Click "Find Path" to see optimal route
4. **Save History**: Login to save paths to your personal history
5. **View History**: Access your previous navigation routes

## Our Future Aim
With the limited time we have managed to build a base model of our idea. In future if we get a chance we can make it a fully fledged application for the entire college including all the floors, name for each room, description of each room, maybe can also link your timetable to the app so it can automatically tell you where your next lecture is. Can also make a 3D render of the college building instead of using a 2D map. So many more unique and interesting ideas we have got for this project but the time limits us.

Anyways, we had these ideas in our head for the longest time since last year and because of this competition we got a chance to bring it to existence.
